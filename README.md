Calculating Discount
# Discount Calculator

This Python script calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. It considers discounts of **20% or higher**; if the discount is less than 20%, the original price remains unchanged.

## Features

- **Discount Threshold**: Applies the discount only if it is 20% or more.
- **User-Friendly Input**: Prompts the user to input the original price and discount percentage.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures valid numeric input for price and discount percentage.
- **Formatted Output**: Displays the final price with two decimal places for clarity.

## How It Works

1. The script defines a function `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` that:
   - Calculates the discounted price if the discount is 20% or higher.
   - Returns the original price if the discount is less than 20%.
2. The user is prompted to enter:
   - The original price of the item.
   - The discount percentage.
3. The script outputs:
   - The final price after applying the discount (if applicable).
   - The original price if no discount was applied.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the script file
2. Run the script in a Python environment:
